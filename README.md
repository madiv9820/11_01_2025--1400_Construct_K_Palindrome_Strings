- ## Approach 1:- Count Odd Frequencies
    - ### Intuition:
        The goal is to determine if we can split the string `s` into `k` palindromic substrings. For a string to form a palindrome:
        - All characters must appear an even number of times, except for at most one character which can appear an odd number of times (this odd character would be placed in the center of the palindrome).

        Given the above property, we need to count how many characters have an odd frequency. If the number of such characters is less than or equal to `k`, then it is possible to form `k` palindromic substrings. Otherwise, itâ€™s not possible.

    - ### Approach:
        1. **Edge Case**: If the length of the string `s` is less than `k`, it is not possible to divide the string into `k` substrings, so we can directly return `True`.   
        2. **Character Frequency Count**: Count the frequency of each character in the string `s` using a frequency counter (e.g., `Counter` in Python).
        3. **Count Odd Frequencies**: Identify how many characters have an odd frequency in the string. This is essential because a palindrome can only have at most one character with an odd frequency.   
        4. **Decision**: If the number of characters with an odd frequency is less than or equal to `k`, return `True`. Otherwise, return `False`.

    - ### Code Implementation
        - **Python Solution**
            ```python3 []
            class Solution:
                def canConstruct(self, s: str, k: int) -> bool:
                    # If the length of the string `s` is less than `k`, 
                    # it's impossible to form `k` palindromic substrings.
                    # Hence, we return True because we can always construct 1 or more palindromes 
                    # as long as the string length is greater than or equal to `k`.
                    if len(s) < k: 
                        return True

                    # Count the number of characters in `s` that appear an odd number of times.
                    # We use Counter to get the frequency of each character in the string.
                    # Then we sum the number of odd frequencies by checking each frequency value.
                    # (1 if the frequency is odd, otherwise 0).
                    letters_With_Odd_Count = sum(1 if freq & 1 else 0 for freq in Counter(s).values())
                    
                    # A palindrome can have at most one character with an odd frequency.
                    # If the number of characters with an odd frequency is less than or equal to `k`, 
                    # it means we can form `k` palindromic substrings, so we return True.
                    return letters_With_Odd_Count <= k
            ```
        - **C++ Solution**
            ```cpp []
            class Solution {
            public:
                bool canConstruct(string s, int k) {
                    // If the length of string `s` is less than `k`, it is impossible to form `k` substrings
                    // (since we need at least one character for each substring)
                    if(s.length() < k) return false;

                    // Array to count the occurrences of each letter in the string (there are 26 lowercase letters)
                    int letterCount[26] = {0};

                    // Loop through the string and count how many times each character appears
                    for(const char& ch: s) ++letterCount[ch-'a'];

                    // Variable to count how many letters have an odd number of occurrences
                    int letter_With_Odd_Count = 0;

                    // Loop through the letter counts and check how many letters have an odd count
                    for(int i = 0; i < 26; ++i) {
                        // If the letter count is odd, increment the odd count
                        if(letterCount[i] & 1) ++letter_With_Odd_Count;
                    }

                    // A palindrome can have at most one letter with an odd frequency (for the center of the palindrome)
                    // To divide the string into `k` palindromic substrings, we need at most `k` odd-count letters
                    return letter_With_Odd_Count <= k;
                }
            };
            ```

    - ### Time Complexity:
        - **$O(n)$**: We loop through the string `s` to count the frequency of each character, where $n$ is the length of the string. Constructing the frequency counter takes $O(n)$ time. 
        - After that, we perform another pass over the frequency counts to count how many characters have odd frequencies. This step takes constant time since there are only 26 possible characters (assuming lowercase English letters). Therefore, the overall time complexity is **$O(n)$**.

    - ### Space Complexity:
        - **$O(1)$**: The space complexity is **$O(1)$** since the frequency count array (or dictionary) will contain at most 26 entries (for 26 lowercase English letters). This is a constant space requirement regardless of the length of the string `s`.

        - Thus, the space complexity is constant, i.e., **$O(1)$**.
